# Code Review — MarkReview

## Overview
The latest update removes all Node-only helper modules and their documentation, leaving MarkReview as a fully front-end package. `package.json` now builds only the browser entry points without the previous `./node` export. The README highlights this front-end focus【F:README.md†L36-L38】 and the export map exposes just the root entry【F:package.json†L51-L53】.

## PRD Coverage
Every functional requirement from `.dev/PRD.md` remains implemented. Tests pass with >87 % coverage and the performance script enforces bundle limits.

### 🔴 Blocking
- None.

### 🟢 Info
- `.dev/AGENTS.md` still lists `next-agent.sh`, but this script was deleted【F:.dev/AGENTS.md†L116-L117】.
- `removeLegacyPackages` is still a stub and could be expanded later【F:src/core/legacyCleanup.ts†L1-L3】.

Routing decision: `ready-for:releasebot`
