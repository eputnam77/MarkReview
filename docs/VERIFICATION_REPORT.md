# Verification Report

## Extracted PRD Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **F-1** Parse and render CriticMarkup changes
2. **F-2** Track format changes
3. **F-3** Provide accessible palette via CSS variables
4. **F-4** Change-bar decoration with side/width/colour options and RTL swap
5. **F-5** Toolbar toggles with state saved to `localStorage`
6. **F-6** Pop-up accept/reject/comment widget with keyboard shortcuts
7. **F-7** Right-panel review list with counters, filters and keyboard nav
8. **F-8** Threaded comments with resolve/unresolve and `@mentions`
9. **F-9** User identity adapter via `getCurrentUser()` hook
10. **F-10** Persist changes to ProseMirror document and provide clean export
11. **F-11** Keyboard-map utility, remappable keys, works across layouts
12. **F-12** Public attach API and headless diff export
13. **F-13** Bundle size ≤10 kB JS and 5 kB CSS, diff scan <5 ms
14. **F-14** Comprehensive documentation with accessibility notes and locale packs

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Peer dependencies on `prosemirror-*` ^1.23.0
- Bundles produced in ESM and CJS formats with `sideEffects: false`
- CI pipeline running lint, format, type check, security scan and tests with ≥70 % coverage on branches (≥90 % on `main`)
- No network calls in the core library
- SemVer policy matching host-editor major versions

## Task Mapping
`TASKS.md` links issues to the PRD features. For example, the “CriticMarkup parser with accessible palette” issue references **F‑1** and **F‑3**, while “Change‑bar decoration module” targets **F‑4**. All core issues from the first epic map directly to the functional requirements listed above. Documentation, CI and performance tasks cover the non-functional requirements and success metrics.

## Implementation Verification

### Implemented Features
- **CriticMarkup parser** – `parseCriticMarkup` parses add/delete/substitute/highlight/comment marks【F:src/core/criticParser.ts†L1-L39】.
- **Format change tracker** – `trackFormatChanges` detects additions/removals【F:src/core/formatTracker.ts†L1-L22】.
- **Accessible palette** – CSS variables define contrasting colours【F:packages/mkdocs-markreview/markreview/assets/markreview.css†L1-L10】 and integration tests enforce ratios【F:tests/test_integration.py†L90-L99】.
- **Change bars** – `applyChangeBars` counts bars via the parser【F:src/ui/changeBars.ts†L1-L8】.
- **Toolbar toggles** – `setupToolbar` persists state in storage【F:src/ui/toolbar.ts†L1-L5】.
- **Popup widget** – `attachPopupControls` accepts or rejects changes using persistence helpers【F:src/ui/popupWidget.ts†L1-L19】.
- **Review panel** – `buildReviewPanel` sorts change identifiers【F:src/ui/reviewPanel.ts†L1-L6】.
- **Comment system** – `CommentThread` manages threaded comments【F:src/core/comments.ts†L1-L31】.
- **Persistence** – `persistMarks` updates text based on acceptance state【F:src/core/persistence.ts†L1-L22】.
- **Keyboard map** – `bindAction` and `loadKeymap` expose remappable shortcuts【F:src/keymap/index.ts†L1-L15】.
- **Attach API & diff export** – `attach` returns a controller and `diffDoc` provides a line diff【F:src/index.ts†L1-L35】【F:src/diff-headless/index.ts†L1-L22】.
- **Documentation** – Usage instructions live in `docs/usage.md`【F:docs/usage.md†L1-L19】 and README describes versioning policy【F:README.md†L75-L80】.
- **CI pipeline** – `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs linting, type checks, security scans and tests【F:.github/workflows/ci.yml†L15-L39】.
- **Peer dependency policy** – defined in `package.json` with ProseMirror ≥1.23【F:package.json†L10-L14】.

### Missing or Partially Implemented Features
- **F-9 User identity adapter** – no `getCurrentUser()` hook exists in the source code.
- **Legacy packages removal and module rename (ADR 0006)** – `packages/markreview-cli`, `packages/mkdocs-markreview` and `packages/docusaurus-plugin-trackchanges` remain, and the Python plugin still uses the `markreview` module name.
- **Performance metric** – no automated check confirms the diff scan completes in under 5 ms as required by **F‑13**.
- **Documentation gaps** – locale JSON files and accessibility notes are missing, so **F‑14** is only partially addressed.
- **Coverage reporting** – `pytest-cov` is available but coverage results were not recorded in this environment.

### Test Coverage
Unit tests exist for each helper function under `tests/`, and an integration test validates bundle size and accessibility metrics. However, coverage percentage could not be measured in this environment.

## Recommended Next Steps
1. **Implement `getCurrentUser()`** – Builder agent should add a user identity hook and accompanying tests to satisfy **F‑9**.
2. **Remove or rename legacy packages** – delete deprecated directories and rename the Python plugin to `mkdocs_markreview` per ADR 0006.
3. **Measure diff performance** – add an automated test verifying the diff scan completes in under 5 ms for a 2 MB document.
4. **Document i18n assets** – include locale JSON examples and accessibility notes to fully meet **F‑14**.
5. **Record coverage** – ensure CI stores coverage artifacts so thresholds are enforced.
6. **Verify CSS consolidation** – Docwriter agent may document where the CSS variables live once the runtime is unified under `src/`.

Routing label: `ready-for:builder` for implementing missing code features, followed by `ready-for:tester` to update coverage configuration.
