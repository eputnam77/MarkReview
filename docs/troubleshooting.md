# Troubleshooting

## Plugin not loading

Ensure the package is installed and listed under `plugins` in your config file. Restart the dev server after installing.

## Styles not applied

Check that your site includes the MarkTrace CSS or that the plugin has injected it. Custom themes may need to import the CSS manually.
