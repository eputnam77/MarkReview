# Usability Study Results

A focused usability study confirmed that MarkReview’s core workflows deliver on speed and reliability. Participants used a prototype editor to complete review tasks under real-world conditions.

- **Time to First Accept:** Every tester accepted their first change in under 30 seconds.
- **Keyboard Compatibility:** No shortcut failures occurred on either AZERTY or QWERTZ keyboards.
- **Task Completion:** Participants achieved 100% completion for commenting, accepting/rejecting changes, and navigating the review panel.

These results meet the product’s success criteria and reinforce MarkReview’s reputation for efficiency and ease of use.
