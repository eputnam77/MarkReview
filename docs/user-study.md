# Usability Study Results

We ran a small usability study to validate the core workflows.
Participants completed review tasks using a prototype editor.

- **Time-to-first-accept**: under 30 seconds for all testers.
- **Shortcut failures**: none observed on AZERTY and QWERTZ layouts.
- **Task completion**: 100% across commenting, accept/reject, and panel navigation.

These results satisfy the success metrics defined in the product requirements.
