## Accessibility & Internationalization

MarkReview is built for inclusivity from the ground up. Every interactive element adheres to WCAG 2.2 AA standards, with clear `aria-label` attributes and contrast ratios that meet or exceed accessibility requirements. This ensures all users—including those relying on assistive technology—can navigate and interact with confidence.

Internationalization is just as seamless. MarkReview provides locale packs with translated labels for toolbars and controls. Simply copy the relevant JSON file from the `locales/` directory into your project and supply it to your preferred UI framework. This approach delivers a consistent, accessible experience across languages and regions.
