# ADR 0009: Security and SemVer Policy

## Context

The PRD lists "no network calls" and states that major versions must track host-editor majors. TASKS.md adds CI checks with `npm audit`, `pip-audit`, and a static scan for `fetch` or `axios` usage. A documented SemVer strategy is required.

## Decision

- The core library and adapters contain **no HTTP clients**. Automated scans fail the build if `fetch` or `axios` are detected.
- GitHub Actions run `pnpm audit` for Node packages and `pip-audit` for Python dependencies on every pull request.
- The README will describe that MarkReview's major version is bumped whenever ProseMirror releases a new major; minor and patch follow standard SemVer rules.

## Consequences

- Security regressions are caught early through automated tooling.
- Consumers can rely on predictable versioning tied to their editor dependency.
- Any future network features live in separate packages so the core remains offlineâ€‘only.
