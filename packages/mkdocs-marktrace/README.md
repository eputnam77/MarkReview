# mkdocs-marktrace

This plugin injects the same change-tracking assets used by the Docusaurus plugin. Added text appears in blue, deletions in red, and changed blocks receive a 3â€‘px bar. A floating selector lets readers toggle between **Original**, **Markup**, and **Accepted** views with the choice saved to `localStorage`.
